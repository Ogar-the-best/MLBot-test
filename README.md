# MLBot-test (forked, hosting for ML.)
Please check the source code for any errors if you want to take the whole code(s) for your discord bot, since he may have not coded everything in right.

## What is MLBot?
MLbot is a multi-functional W.I.P discord bot made by Minelordsuniverse, He have browsed through countless youtube tutorials and other repositories to complete coding everything for this bot.
MLBot has:

1. Moderation commands
2. Music commands
3. Other fun/misc. commands.

Note: This bot is still under development, this is just the first version of the bot, yet to be hosted. Please check Minelordsuniverse's page for any new code, because this is just forked so that I can host it for Minelordsuniverse.

## If you want to take the source codes for your discord bot:
Make sure to make a .env file (install the dotenv package), and add in your client id, and other API's which you want to add, make sure to install all the packages too (check package.json if you want to see what packages I used), of course make sure to install discord.js (package) and discord.js-commando (package) as well. 

Again, **this was forked for hosting purposes. I am not responsible for the bugs that may happen.**
