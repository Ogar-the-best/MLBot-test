# MLBot-test
Please check the source code for any errors if you want to take the whole code(s) for your discord bot, since I may have not coded everything in right

## What is MLBot?
MLbot is a multi-functional W.I.P discord bot made by me, I have browsed through countless youtube tutorials and other repositories to complete coding everything for this bot.
MLBot has:

1. Moderation commands
2. Music commands
3. Other fun/misc. commands.

Note: This bot is still under development, this is just the first version of the bot, yet to be hosted.

## If you want to take the source codes for your discord bot:
Make sure to make a .env file (install the dotenv package), and add in your client id, and other API's which you want to add, make sure to install all the packages too (check package.json if you want to see what packages I used), of course make sure to install discord.js (package) and discord.js-commando (package) as well.
